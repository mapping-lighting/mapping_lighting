# Introduction

This manual describes the processes involved in administering the Mapping Lighting application.

Topics covered include;

  * logging in and user management,
  * exploring and exporting observation data,
  * and managing observations.

The Mapping Lighting application is a web based application, serving both desktop and mobile users from the same codebase.
The application supports two main use cases;

  1. The collection of observations of artificial light sources by the general public.
  2. The management of observations, including moderation and searching and exporting, for researchers.

This manual focuses on the latter use case.
